# Career Studio - Pricing Strategy

**Date:** January 2026
**Owner:** CTO/Product Manager
**Status:** Draft - Requires WTP Validation

---

## Executive Summary

Career Studio will pursue a **hybrid B2B + B2C** pricing model:
- **B2B (Schools):** Per-student licensing with tiered pricing
- **B2C (Direct):** Freemium with premium subscription

This approach de-risks revenue by not depending on a single channel while building both brand awareness (B2C) and sustainable revenue (B2B).

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Value-based, not cost-based** - Price reflects outcome value to users
2. **Land and expand** - Start free/low, prove value, then upsell
3. **Transparency** - Clear pricing, no hidden fees
4. **Regional sensitivity** - Pricing appropriate for MENA market
5. **Annual preference** - Incentivize annual plans for predictability

### Competitive Context

From competitive analysis:

| Competitor | Model | Price Point |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Bayt.com | Free for seekers, employer pays | $130-160/job post |
| Noon Academy | Freemium | Subscription (varies) |
| Almentor | B2C + B2B | Enterprise licensing |
| HRDF Sobol | Free (govt) | N/A |
| MyFuture.edu.au | Free (govt) | N/A |

**Key Insight:** No direct competitor charges for career exploration in MENA. We're creating a new category.
