# MENA Career Data Sources Research Report

**Research Date:** January 22, 2026 (Updated: January 23, 2026)
**Purpose:** Identify authentic Arab career/occupation data sources for Career Studio bilingual platform

---

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates Arab/MENA career and occupation data sources across the entire MENA region (not just GCC). The most promising immediate options are:

1. **ESCO (Arabic)** - Freely available with API access, comprehensive skills/occupations data in CSV/RDF/ODS formats
2. **Qatar QNOC 2024** - Publicly downloadable PDF with 3,717 job titles
3. **Saudi SSCO** - Available through GASTAT, ISCO-08 aligned
4. **ILO ISCO-08 Arabic** - Excel file now available for download with bilingual EN/AR structure

For authentic Arab-originated classification, ASCO 2008 remains the gold standard but requires direct engagement with Arab Labor Organization or Jordan's NCHRD (which hosts a downloadable Arabic version).
