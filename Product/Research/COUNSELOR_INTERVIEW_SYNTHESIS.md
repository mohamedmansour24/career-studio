## Key Insights

### 1. Current Tools & Resources

| Counselor | Tools Used | Content Sources |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Kamal** | WhatsApp groups, Facebook | Arabic psychology books, YouTube channels, asking colleagues |
| **Mariana** | PowerPoint, Google Forms, YouTube, SCL (LMS), tablets | Psychology books, professional influencers |
| **Sulaiman** | Email, internal systems | Agreed topics at start of year |

**Insight:** No dedicated career guidance platform mentioned. Counselors rely on generic tools (PowerPoint, WhatsApp) and informal sources (books, YouTube, colleagues).

---

### 2. Pain Points Identified

| Category | Pain Points | Quotes/Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Student Engagement** | Students don't collaborate when referred | "When the student does not collaborate with you when referred by someone else" - Kamal |
| **Stigma** | Students view counseling negatively | "Some students are not convinced of guidance (stigma)" - Sulaiman |
| **Parent Cooperation** | Parents only engage for problems | "Is my daughter in trouble? No? Then I'm not coming" - Mariana |
| **Administrative Burden** | Too much paperwork and routine | "Routine and administrative work" - Mariana |
| **Scheduling** | Hard to find time for sessions | "Difficulty in scheduling counseling interviews" - Sulaiman |
| **Ethical Conflicts** | Admin requests against standards | "When administration asks me to do something against my moral standards" - Kamal |
| **Workload** | Session overload at peak times | "7-8 sessions at end/beginning of semester" - Kamal |

---

### 3. Common Student Challenges

| Challenge | Counselor Mentions |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Family problems | Mariana, Kamal |
| Academic issues | Sulaiman (most common) |
| Emotions/relationships | Kamal |
| Time management | Kamal |
| Social adaptation | Kamal |
| Bullying | Kamal |
| Disconnection from world | Mariana |

**Insight:** Academic and family issues dominate. Career guidance appears secondary to crisis management.

---

### 4. Career Guidance Practices

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Frequency** | "Regularly" but reactive, not systematic |
| **Methods** | Life skills classes, individual sessions, group sessions |
| **Topics** | Time management, study skills, emotions - NOT career exploration |
| **Structure** | Yearly plans exist but focused on general wellbeing |

**Insight:** Career guidance is NOT a primary function. Counselors focus on behavioral/psychological issues. Career exploration is a gap.

---

### 5. Success Metrics Used

| Counselor | How They Measure Success |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Kamal** | Student grades, progress in case, student feedback |
| **Mariana** | Discipline (indebaat), ability to control environment |
| **Sulaiman** | Quarterly supervisory visits, archived files review |

**Insight:** No career outcome tracking. Success = behavioral compliance + academic grades.

---

### 6. Referral Sources & Volume

| Source | Volume |
|--------|--------|
| Student self-referral | 4-5 per week (Kamal) |
| Teacher referral | Via formal form |
| Professor referral | University level |

**Peak times:** Beginning and end of semester (exam stress, transitions)

---

### 7. Schools With Strong Counseling (Jordan)

Mentioned by Kamal as exemplary:
- Omareyeh School
- Ahleyeh and Mutraan
- King's Academy
- IB (Baccalaureate) schools
- IAA - International Academy Amman

**Insight:** International/IB schools and premium private schools are early adopters of counseling best practices. Target market validation.

---

### 8. Cultural Context

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Family involvement** | Critical but parents resist engagement |
| **Hierarchy** | Strong admin hierarchy affects counselor autonomy |
| **Religion/Values** | "Islamic values + open minded" balance mentioned |
| **Career aspirations** | "Doctors, Engineers, Businessmen, Their own business" - parent expectations |
| **Gender** | Female counselors work with girls (Mariana), separate mention of gender dynamics |

---

## Product Implications

### Validated Assumptions

| Assumption | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **P1: Career confusion is real** | Counselors deal with academic/life issues but NOT structured career guidance |
| **P3: Counselors need better tools** | Using PowerPoint, WhatsApp - no dedicated platform |
| **B1: Schools will pay** | Premium schools already invest in counseling infrastructure |

### New Insights for Product

1. **Reduce stigma** - Position as "career exploration" not "counseling"
2. **Involve parents** - Parents need a reason to engage; career planning is compelling
3. **Save time** - Counselors are overloaded; tool must reduce, not add work
4. **Track outcomes** - No career metrics exist; opportunity to provide value
5. **Content in Arabic** - Kamal references Arabic books; Mariana's notes in Arabic
6. **Mobile-first** - WhatsApp is primary communication channel

### Features to Prioritize

Based on counselor needs:

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Student self-service** | Reduce counselor burden |
| **Parent portal** | Give parents compelling reason to engage |
| **Progress tracking** | Fill gap in outcome measurement |
| **Arabic content** | Match existing content consumption |
| **Scheduling integration** | Address scheduling pain point |
| **Admin reports** | Meet supervision requirements |

## Gaps in Research

### What We Still Don't Know

1. **Willingness to pay** - No pricing discussion in interviews
2. **Decision maker** - Is it counselor, principal, or ministry?
3. **Budget cycle** - When do schools buy EdTech?
4. **Competitive landscape** - What tools do they currently evaluate?
5. **Technical readiness** - School IT infrastructure varies

### Recommended Follow-up

1. Interview school administrators/principals about purchasing
2. Survey counselors on pricing sensitivity
3. Test prototype with 2-3 counselors for feedback
