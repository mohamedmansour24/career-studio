"35","Anthropologist","","Do you ever find yourself staring into the void, wondering about the mysteries of life? Like, why is your skin white and not black? Why do you walk on two legs and not four? Why do you speak Arabic and not English? If you're constantly plagued by these existential questions, then you might want to consider becoming an anthropologist.

But what exactly is anthropology, you ask? Well, it's a fancy Greek word that essentially means ""the study of humans."" Basically, anthropologists are like detectives for humanity. They're constantly searching for answers to the big questions about where we come from, how we adapt to different environments, and how we communicate and interact with each other. So if you're looking for a career that will really make you think, then maybe anthropology is the right choice for you. Just don't forget to pack your sense of humor - it's a wild and wacky world out there!

"39","Archeologists","","If you've ever been to a museum or an archaeological site, you know that the ancient world is full of mysteries. From giant statues to mysterious symbols and inscriptions, there's always something new to discover. But have you ever wondered how all of these amazing artifacts were found in the first place? Who figured out their history and what they meant? Who made sure they were preserved and put on display for us to see today?

The answer is archaeologists! These fearless adventurers are the experts when it comes to uncovering the secrets of the past. They dig up ancient artifacts, decipher inscriptions, and study the cultures of long-gone civilizations. So if you're the type of person who loves a good mystery and isn't afraid to get your hands dirty, then maybe a career in archaeology is the right choice for you. Just don't forget your sense of humor - after all, you never know what you might uncover!","Identify and survey sites using a variety of methods, including field walking, geophysical surveys, aerial photography and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology

provide advice on the conservation or recording of archaeological remains
ensure important buildings, monuments and sites are protected and preserved
assist in the curating and display of artefacts.","Critical thinking: As a paleontologist, you'll need to be a master of thinking outside the box (or in this case, outside the fossil). You'll need to be able to look at a fossil and figure out what it was, how it lived, and why it died.
Problem-solving: When you're a paleontologist, there's no such thing as a ""stump-the-chump"" question. You'll need to be able to come up with clever solutions to tough problems, like how to explain why the dinosaurs went extinct (spoiler alert: it wasn't because they didn't have a good enough lawyer).
Communication: Paleontologists don't just talk to other paleontologists – they also have to explain their findings to people who don't have a degree in dino-studying. You'll need to be able to communicate your ideas clearly and concisely, whether you're giving a presentation to a group of students or writing an article for a scientific journal.
Collaboration: Paleontologists aren't lone wolves – they often work in teams to collect and analyze data. You'll need to be able to work well with others and share your ideas, even if you don't always agree (after all, not everyone thinks T. rex was as cool as you do).
Adaptability: The field of paleontology is always changing, with new discoveries and technologies being made all the time. You'll need to be able to adapt to these changes and learn new skills as needed, like how to use a 3D printer to make a model of a fossil (yes, that's a real thing).","","","","","","High","Moderate","Low","Low"
